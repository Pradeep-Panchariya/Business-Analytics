## Analyze NYSE Data

**Why this Project?**
This project will introduce you to the data analysis process that you will be using throughout the rest of the Nanodegree program. In this project, you will go through the process of calculating summary statistics, drawing an inference from the statistics, calculating business metrics and using models to forecast future growth prospects for the companies. The goal is for you to perform an analysis and also create visual tools to communicate the results in informative ways.

We have provided a clean data set for this project. Although in real life scenarios, data sets often need to be cleaned and processed before analysis can proceed. This project allows you to see what a clean data set should look like.

**Background**:
We used the Fundamentals.csv and Securities.csv files provided by Kaggle. The Fundamentals file provides the fundamental financial data gathered from SEC 10K annual filings from 448 companies listed on the S&P 500 index. The Securities file provided the industry or sector information the companies are categorized under on the S&P 500 index.

**What skills will I use?**

The main goal of this project is for you to demonstrate your ability to:

    * interpret the measures of central tendency and spread (mean, median, standard deviation, range)
    * use a combination of Excel or Google Sheets functions (e.g., IF statements, INDEX and MATCH, calculating descriptive statistics with the IF statement, drop downs, data validation, VLOOKUP).
    * analyze and forecast financial business metrics using Excel or Google Sheets.
    * create visualizations of a business metric and use Excel or Google Sheets to create a financial forecast model.

You will need to create a presentation and spreadsheet to be reviewed. The details of this submission are provided in the last page in this lesson. Pay attention to the details of the [Rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/2347/view) to assure you have all deliverables. In order to have your presentation reviewed, you will need to save your slides as a PDF. You can save your spreadsheet as a Microsoft Excel workbook or Google spreadsheet.

## Understanding the Data

**Cleaning Up The Data**

Although you do not need to follow these for setting up the dataset, these are some suggestions:

Change all the column names to have no spaces, but still be informative. This isn't necessary, but just a recommendation. Depending on what you do with the data in the future having spaces or special characters in the column names may not work nicely. You will see this in the next content on SQL.
**The following information is included in the Project data NYSE file**:
    * Ticker symbol: Stock symbol
    * Years: Number of years for which data is provided
    * Period ending
    * Total revenue
    * Cost of goods sold
    * Sales, General and Administrative expenses
    * Research and Development expenses
    * Other Operating expense items
    * Global Industry Classification Standard (GICS) Sector: Industry sector the company is categorized under (e.g., American Airlines with the ticker symbol AAL is categorized under Industrials.)
    * GICS Sub Industry: Sub-industry sector the company is categorized under (e.g., AAL is further categorized under the sub-category of Airlines industry.)

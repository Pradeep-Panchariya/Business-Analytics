5. **[Grouping data:](#grouping-data)** We will end with a discussion on how to look at the data across groups, cohorts, and time.


## Key Performance Indicators

Businesses need to be able to track how they are performing on key goals or objectives - whether they are growing number of customers, bringing down their costs, increasing revenue on an ongoing basis and myriad others. **Key Performance Indicators or KPIs** are how they measure their success on each of their key business objectives.

**Which KPI to use?**

The decision regarding which KPI a business analyst should use depends on several factors, including which industry or domain they are working in, which business function they are focusing on, and the type of data they have available to them.

**WeCart Case Study for this lesson**

To help you master the various concepts throughout this lesson, we will use a case study of an online app throughout this lesson. The online app is designed to pick up groceries from different stores and delivers it to the customer’s home. We will assume WeCart uses a subscription model where people set up accounts and place orders on a regular basis. You’ll find examples referencing WeCart throughout this lesson.

**Business Process Flow: Marketing**

**Business Process Flow: Growth**

The following video describes a typical question business analysts try to answer when they are considering issues of a company's growth. To grow the business, companies need to not only focus on existing customers, but also new customers. This problem is at the heart of growth metric. Executive boards, investors and sales teams are constantly keeping their eye on this critical question about a company's overall health.

**New Vocabulary**

**Call To Action**: A marketing term that refers to an action a website visitor is supposed to take when given a specific prompt on a website. These can be words or phrases, or icons that prompt and encourage the user to perform the action.

**Post-Purchase**: Actions customers take after purchasing an item that promote and increase sales and advocate on behalf of the company. For e.g., coming back and purchasing more items, sharing or liking the company or product on social media, taking pictures of the item and tagging it on Pinterest.

**Two Additional Levels**

Before we move on, I wanted to share 2 more levels that companies use.

**Loyalty**

To grow their revenue and company profits, companies don’t just want their customers to buy once from them, but to come back to their website. Especially if the product is not a high-priced product. That customer loyalty allows you to track how many revisits a customer is making after their first purchase, or how many of the customers have continued shopping after their first purchase.

**Metrics**: Some commonly used metrics include Repeat Purchase Rate and Net Promoter Score. We will not be going in depth with these, but please do check out the resources below to learn more about them.

**Advocacy**

Another level companies sometimes track is whether their customer is advocating for their company. That is, saying good things about the product and services. Leaning on social media provides a great opportunity to do just that.

**Metrics**: Some commonly used metrics include Customer Referrals and Leads from Social Media. For example, as the paid customer tweets about the company, likes the product on FB, provides a good rating on Amazon or the company website, analysts can use those metrics, such as ratings and likes to show how many of the customers serve as advocates.

We will not be going in depth with these last two stage levels, but we have provided some resources below to help you understand these more.

**New Vocabulary**

* **Search Engine Optimization (SEO)** : The goal of search engine optimization is to influence the frequency of a website appearing in response to specific search terms in a search engine. You can learn more about it on this [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine_optimization) and this [Forbes article](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jaysondemers/2018/02/28/the-first-9-things-you-should-learn-in-seo/#7c150b7030f9).
* **Lead**: A potential customer interested in the products or services of a company.
* **Conversion**: When the lead (potential customer) purchases the products or services being sold by a company.
* **Repurchase Rate**: This [Medium blog](https://medium.com/@matsutton/repurchase-rate-the-most-overlooked-ecommerce-kpi-337bccde184b) describes how to calculate Repurchase Rate metrics.
* **Net Promoter Score**: This [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_Promoter) describes the calculations and origin of NPS.

### Click Through Rate (CTR)

As potential customers view the ads, some of those potential customers will click the ad and be taken to the website for the company. To be counted at this level, the user needs to click through the ad and the metric we use here is **Click Through Rate**.

![image](./Misc/008.png)

To calculate Click Through Rate, let’s cover a few key concepts. Make sure you are making a note of this terminology and definitions.

**Terminology**

- **Impressions** record an instance of an advertisement appearing on a website when it is viewed by a visitor. So if you visit the page 4 times, say in one hour, the gross impression count will include each repeated viewing.

- **Clicks**: Every time a website visitor views the ad and clicks it, this gets included in the Click count”

**Calculation**

`Click Through Rate = (Number of Clicks / Number of Impressions) X 100`

**Interpretation of CTR**

The Click Through Rate is an informative metric that informs your marketing team whether they should try and increase the number of impressions or when they should reword the ad to increase clicks. Remember, if a person clicks through the ad, it does not mean the customer purchased, but rather they are showing interest in what the ad is about.

When your CTR is low, your ad campaign is not generating enough interest. When the CTR increases, it is an indicator of an effective and interesting content in your ad campaign and that maybe you should increase the number of impressions for that ad.

**Benchmarks for CTRs for Google Ads across industries**.
Check out this blog that provides useful benchmarks for CTRs across industries: [Wordstream Blog](https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/02/29/google-adwords-industry-benchmarks)

#### Recap:
- **Click Through Rate (CTR)** = (Clicks/ Impressions) * 100 or Ratio of users clicking on a link or an ad to the number of total users who received the link or saw the ad.

- CTR measures the success of an advertising campaign or email campaign.

- When the CTR increases, it is an indicator of an effective and interesting content in your ad campaign and that maybe you should increase the number of impressions for that ad.


**Advanced Topics**

A related concept called **Unique Click Through Rate** is examined when looking at email campaigns to see how often a link sent through an email was opened by person receiving the email. If the person receiving the email clicks on the link 5 times, the unique CTR stays one, even though the total CTR is 5. Comparing the unique versus total CTR can help the analyst know if the email campaign reflects interest among potential customers.

We will not be going into unique CTR in detail in this lesson, but if you are interested in learning more about it, the following web pages are good resources for you to explore.
